# PDF.it - Accomplished Work

## QA Bug Fix Sprint (March 30, 2026) — 32 Bugs Resolved

External QA tester reported 39 bugs (32 unique after deduplication). All addressed across 20+ files, 3 languages (EN/ES/BR).

### Priority 1 — High (Fixed)
- **BUG-001**: Forgot password email not received — full fix:
  - Built custom `/api/forgot-password` route that sends reset emails through Resend directly (bypasses Supabase's built-in email sender which wasn't reaching users)
  - Branded HTML email template matching PDF.it design, sent from `noreply@pdf.it.com`
  - Installed `resend` package (requires `RESEND_API_KEY` env var on Vercel)
  - Built `/reset-password` page with password form, eye toggle, validation
  - Reset link routes through `/auth/confirm` to exchange token for session before landing on `/reset-password` (same proven flow as signup confirmation)
  - Added "check junk/spam folder" message on the reset email sent screen
- **BUG-002**: Footer social media icons had `href="#"` — replaced with real URLs (placeholder until accounts created), all 3 languages
- **BUG-003**: Generic 400 error on corrupted PDF in PDF-to-TXT — added user-friendly error messages in `api/pdf-to-txt/route.ts`
- **BUG-004**: Edit/pencil icon not clickable after upload — now focuses and selects filename input on click
- **BUG-005**: Language switcher not working — confirmed working after dropdown conversion (BUG-037)
- **BUG-006**: Pricing card text cut off after language change — removed `overflow-hidden` from card divs (EN/ES/BR pricing pages)
- **BUG-007**: 400 error splitting single-page PDF — added page count validation with `pdf-lib` before calling API, friendly error message
- **BUG-008**: Eye icon missing in PDF password field — outside scope (browser's native PDF viewer)
- **BUG-009**: No validation on contact form name field — added `minLength`, `pattern`, trim validation on form + API
- **BUG-010**: FAQ accordion no collapse icon — already working (ChevronUp/ChevronDown with toggle)
- **BUG-011**: Captcha error persists after verification — `onVerify` callback now clears error state (signup + login)
- **BUG-013**: Navigation allowed during file upload — added `beforeunload` warning during processing
- **BUG-016 + BUG-036**: Mobile hamburger menu text invisible — changed `text-slate-700` to `text-white/80` (all 3 headers)
- **BUG-019**: "Limit Exceeded" on signup — friendly message for Supabase rate limit errors
- **BUG-020**: JPG/PNG to PDF labeled FREE but gated as Pro — removed Pro pre-gate from `image-to-pdf-interface.tsx`

### Priority 2 — Medium (Fixed)
- **BUG-021**: "Email Us" button broken without email client — replaced `mailto:` with copy-to-clipboard button showing email address
- **BUG-022**: Missing asterisks on Email/Password fields in signup — added `*` indicators
- **BUG-023**: Duplicate footer links (Privacy, Terms, Contact) — removed duplicate bottom bar links
- **BUG-024**: Page bottom visible during PDF-to-JPG upload — added `min-h-[60vh]` to processing state
- **BUG-025**: File disappears on refresh — added privacy message explaining files are cleared on refresh
- **BUG-026**: Layout shift on language change — expected behavior (full page navigation)
- **BUG-027**: Header logo not linking home — already fixed (was wrapped in `<Link href="/">`)
- **BUG-028 + BUG-032**: Footer logo not clickable — wrapped in `<Link>` (all 3 languages)
- **BUG-029**: No hover effect on A-Z alphabet letters — added `hover:text-[#14D8C4] hover:bg-white/5`
- **BUG-030 + BUG-034**: Upload button not disabled after first file — free users: new file replaces old; paid users: "Add more files" button below file list; big upload zone hides after first file
- **BUG-031 + BUG-033**: Active nav state not highlighted — added `usePathname()` check with teal highlight for current page

### Priority 3 — Low (Fixed)
- **BUG-035**: Background scrolls when hamburger menu open — added `overflow: hidden` to body (all 3 headers)
- **BUG-037**: Language selector as flag row — converted to dropdown menu with globe icon, flag + language name (all 3 headers, desktop + mobile)
- **BUG-038**: Blog card dates not visible — improved contrast from `text-slate-500` to `text-slate-400`
- **BUG-039**: "Back to Dashboard" button text invisible — changed to teal text with teal border

### Additional Improvements
- **BUG-014**: A-Z scroll offset — increased `scroll-mt` from 32 to 36 for sticky nav clearance

### Performance & Branding Fixes (March 29, 2026)

- All Pro/Business routes now properly import and call logUsage with user.id

## Bug Fixes — March 23 2026
- **Enterprise locked out of QR Code (all 3 languages)** — `app/tools/qr-code/page.tsx`, `app/es/codigo-qr/page.tsx`, `app/br/codigo-qr/page.tsx`: client-side plan check was missing `"enterprise"`, blocking $49.99/month subscribers from accessing the tool
- **pdf-to-txt missing maxDuration** — `app/api/pdf-to-txt/route.ts`: added `maxDuration = 300` to match all other processing routes; without it Vercel defaulted to 60s and Business/Enterprise users with large files would time out
- **qr-code API wrong error format for unauthenticated users** — `app/api/qr-code/route.ts`: changed response from `{ error: "You must be logged in..." }` / 401 to `{ error: "upgrade_required" }` / 403 so the frontend correctly redirects to /pricing
- **qr-code API missing logUsage** — `app/api/qr-code/route.ts`: added `logUsage(user.id, "qr-code")` after successful generation; Pro/Business/Enterprise QR code usage was invisible in the database
- **Admin limits page showed "10" for Enterprise users** — `app/admin/limits/page.tsx`: added `"enterprise"` to the Unlimited condition; Enterprise subscribers saw "10 daily conversions" instead of "Unlimited"
- **Table extraction charged Document AI before enforcing page cap** — `app/api/table-extraction/route.js`: added pdf-lib pre-flight page count after buffer download; if the PDF exceeds the user's remaining monthly quota it now rejects before calling Document AI instead of after, eliminating wasted API cost (~$0.03/page)

## Bug Fixes — March 24 2026 (QA Report — Critical)
- **SB-01: Signup confirmation email failing** — Added `captchaToken` to `supabase.auth.signUp()` options in all 3 signup pages (EN/ES/BR); without it Supabase rejected the request server-side when hCaptcha was enabled
- **SB-15/22: Missing Forgot Password on login** — Added "Forgot Password" button with `resetPasswordForEmail` flow to all 3 login pages; created `app/reset-password/page.tsx` for new password entry; also fixed missing `captchaToken` in `signInWithPassword()` on all 3 login pages
- **SB-28: Missing password eye icon on signup** — Added Eye/EyeOff visibility toggle to Password and Confirm Password fields on all 3 signup pages
- **SB-11: Merge PDF only allows 1 file** — Fixed `processing-interface.tsx`: free users now get 2 files for merge (was 1), paid users unlimited; `multiple` attribute enabled on file input for merge tool
- **SB-27: "Email Us Directly" button not working** — Added explicit `onClick` with `window.location.href` for mailto on all 3 homepage FAQ buttons; fixed BR page from `suporte@` to `contact@pdf.it.com`
- **SB-30: Captcha misaligned on login** — Added `overflow-hidden` to hCaptcha wrapper div on all 3 login pages

## Bug Fixes — March 24 2026 (QA Report — Medium)
- **SB-02: OCR Scanner blank after removing file** — `removeFile()` in `ocr-pdf-interface.tsx` now resets all state variables (processing, error, complete, progress, processedFile), not just the file
- **SB-03: Same file cannot be re-uploaded after deletion** — Added `input.value = ""` reset in OCR `removeFile()` and `resetInterface()`; added `onClick` value reset to all 12 file input components project-wide
- **SB-06: Password eye icon disappears after full entry** — Hidden native browser password reveal buttons (`[&::-ms-reveal]:hidden`, `[&::-webkit-credentials-auto-fill-button]:hidden`) and added `z-10` to custom eye button on all 3 login pages
- **SB-09: Split PDF fails on single-page PDF** — Already had pdf-lib pre-check in `split-pdf-interface.tsx` (validates page count before upload, shows "This PDF has only 1 page and cannot be split")
- **SB-29: Selected file removed when canceling file dialog** — Added `onClick={(e) => { (e.target as HTMLInputElement).value = "" }}` to all 12 file input elements; resets value before dialog opens so cancel doesn't trigger onChange

## Bug Fixes — March 24 2026 (QA Report — Low Priority)
- **SB-05/07: Social media footer icons scroll to top** — Converted `Link` to `<a>` with `target="_blank"` `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and `onClick={(e) => e.preventDefault()}` in all 3 footers
- **SB-08: Vague error messages on upload** — Added specific messages in `processing-interface.tsx` catch block: file too large, unsupported format, network error
- **SB-17: Screen flickers on nav click** — Added placeholder `div` with matching dimensions in all 3 headers while auth state loads, preventing layout shift
- **SB-24: Yearly plan resets to monthly** — Billing toggle selection now persists to `localStorage` and restores on page load in `app/pricing/page.tsx`
- **SB-19: Download button misaligned on mobile** — Changed file result card to `flex-col sm:flex-row` layout; download button goes full-width on mobile (`w-full sm:w-auto`)
- **SB-32/33: Contact form fields cut off** — Changed name/email grid from `md:grid-cols-2` to single column to prevent placeholder truncation
- **SB-35/36: Email and filename overflow on mobile** — Added `truncate`, `max-w-[200px]`, and `break-all` to file names and email addresses
- **SB-37: UI distorted on mobile after conversion** — Added `overflow-x-hidden` on success state section in `processing-interface.tsx`

## PDF.it Rebrand (COMPLETE — March 24 2026)
- Global find-and-replace: PDF.it → PDF.it across all pages, components, metadata
